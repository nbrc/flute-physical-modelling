# Flute Physical Modelling

Welcome to the Flute Physical Modelling repository! This GitHub repository contains Python code and Max patches for implementing flute physical modelling based on the work of Cook, Garton, Karjalainen, and Välimäki. The implementation allows you to simulate and synthesize the sound of a flute using physical modelling techniques.

## Introduction

The flute physical modelling technique aims to simulate the behavior and sound of a flute by modeling the physical components and interactions involved. This repository provides you with the necessary code and resources to understand and explore flute physical modelling using both Python and Max.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/nbrc/flute-physical-modelling.git
   ```

2. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. The Python code is provided as Jupyter notebooks, so you need to have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed on your system. Additionally, you will need Max/MSP software to run the Max patches.

3. Install the Python dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

This repository provides two different ways to explore and utilize the flute physical modelling:

### Python Code

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab environment on your system.

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory.

3. Open the provided Jupyter notebooks in the `python` directory to explore and run the Python code.

### Max Patches

1. Launch Max/MSP software on your system.

2. Navigate to the `max` directory and open the Max patches provided.

3. Follow the instructions and explore the different Max patches to simulate and synthesize the sound of a flute using physical modelling.

Feel free to choose the approach that suits your needs or explore both for a comprehensive understanding of flute physical modelling.

## Folder Structure

The repository has the following structure:

- `python/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks implementing flute physical modelling in Python.
- `max/`: Contains Max patches for simulating and synthesizing the sound of a flute.
